The problem: There are n- robots of red, green, blue color. Exist m- toys, which must be painted red, blue green colors. A program implemets a multithreading
approach to this task: alll the robots is a separated threads, which make a request to a scheduler, which gives job to robots. On small times( ~10 ms), algorithm
consumes +- 40 seconds. THe higher robots` work time, the less the consumption of general time.
